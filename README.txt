We implemented every part we mentioned in Part1 except that the user enters only city name (not both city and state)
to search for hotels. We changed this way since all cities have unique names in our database and we specified 
states inside the parenthesis to still avoid confusion. 

- When the user enters the city (without state--a minon the home page, it leads to a page which displays a list of hotels
in the city with additional information.

- When the user selects the hotel by clicking the button with hotel_id on it, it displays a list of rooms as well as 
unavailable dates booked by other customers

- The user can book a room by simply entering the room number and his/her information as well as travel companion's if necessary
